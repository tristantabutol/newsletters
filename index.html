                    <h1>Importance of Eating Healthy food</h1>
                    <p>Eating vegetables provides health benefits.
					People who eat more vegetables and fruits as part
					of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced 
					risk of some chronic diseases. Vegetables provide nutrients
					vital for health and maintenance of your body.Eating healthy isn’t always easy, but committing to a healthy diet
					can be one of the smartest decisions you ever make. Why? Not only can eating well make you look and feel better,
					it can also save you money on future health costs.
					But even if you intend to “eat healthy,” knowing exactly what that means
					can be challenging. “Following a healthy diet includes choosing plenty of lean meats,
					eggs, vegetables, fruit, whole grain and dairy products,” says Debra Nessel,
					a registered dietitian with Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California.
					Eating well also means leaving out or only rarely consuming foods that are high in added sugar, 
					saturated fat and sodium. That includes most fast food, full-calorie sodas, processed snacks 
					like chips and crackers, and anything with more milligrams of sodium than there are calories in a serving.
					If you need some help getting motivated, here are the top reasons to sneak a few more nutrient-packed foods into your diet.</p>

                    <p>Most vegetables are naturally low in fat and calories. None have cholesterol. (Sauces or seasonings may add fat, calories, and/or cholesterol.)
Vegetables are important sources of many nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, folate (folic acid), vitamin A, and vitamin C.
Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Vegetable sources of potassium include sweet potatoes, white potatoes, white beans, tomato products (paste, sauce, and juice), beet greens, soybeans, lima beans, spinach, lentils, and kidney beans.
Dietary fiber from vegetables, as part of an overall healthy diet, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease. Fiber is important for proper bowel function. It helps reduce constipation and diverticulosis. Fiber-containing foods such as vegetables help provide a feeling of fullness with fewer calories.
Folate (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant should consume adequate folate from foods, and in addition 400 mcg of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods or supplements. This reduces the risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida, and anencephaly during fetal development.
Vitamin A keeps eyes and skin healthy and helps to protect against infections.
Vitamin C helps heal cuts and wounds and keeps teeth and gums healthy. Vitamin C aids in iron absorption.
